# Kenya-Sign-Language
This repository contains an analysis of images of Kenya Sign Language(KSL) and aims at being able to interpret images in nine classes namely; *church*, *me*, *you*, *love*, *temple*, *seat*, *mosque*, *friend* and *enough*. I also created an interface using `streamlit` through which you can interact with the trained model. The application can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KaburaJ/KSL_imageClassificationApp).
